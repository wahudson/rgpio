=head1		DESCRIPTION

This class provides memory blocks that map to GPIO hardware peripherals.
It provides the fundamental access for all the other librgpio classes.

The essential operation is to open /dev/mem (or /dev/gpiomem).
Then use mmap() system call to map a real address page into this process
virtual memory.  Finaly, read/write to addresses in that page go directly to
the peripheral hardware registers.

The object caches each map entry, and will return the same block of memory
if it has already been mapped.

=head2			Privilege Capabilities

The "capabilities" system is used to provide access to /dev/mem for normal
users without using 'sudo' or applying "setuid root" to the executable.
See cababilities(7).

Capabilities 'CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE' and 'CAP_SYS_RAWIO' are necessary to open
/dev/mem for read/write access.  Once the file is open, the capabilities
can be dropped.  The open_dev_file() function raises these two capabilities
from the "Permitted" set into the "Effective" set just before opening, and
drops them afterward.

These capabilities get into the process "Permitted" set by being applied
to the file "Permitted" set on the executable file.  E.g. by command:

    sudo setcap 'CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,CAP_SYS_RAWIO=p'  file

In this way the executing process has no special capability outside of the
open device file function.

=head2			Constructor and Configuration

The constructor takes no arguments.  It creates an object with no device
file open.

The config_*() functions are intended to be called once before the device
file is opened.

=over

=item config_Debug()

Set debug mode, 1= on, 0= off.
When Debug is TRUE, debug output on stderr is enabled.  Currently this
is comments on the "capabilities" raise/lower in the process of opening
the device file.

=item config_FakeNoPi()

Configure fall-back action when not on a Raspberry Pi:  1= fake memory with
a warning, 0= throw error.
Applies only when a real file is opened, i.e. open_dev_mem(), or
open_dev_gpiomem().

=item config_BaseAddr()		get/set real IO BaseAddr

Call with no argument to return the current BaseAddr.
Call with an argument to configure the real IO base address to be used.
A null address will cause a fake memory block to be used regardless of the
device file opened.
Addresses for existing Raspberry Pi versions are:

 0x20000000  RPi1,
 0x3f000000  RPi2,3
 0xfe000000  RPi4

=back

=head2			Device File

These functions open the specified device file, and are the preferred user
interface.

=over

=item open_dev_mem()

Open "/dev/mem", providing full access to all hardware peripherals.

=item open_dev_gpiomem()

Open "/dev/gpiomem", providing access only to the GPIO pin functions.

=item open_fake_mem()

Open a fake memory block, no device file.  The same memory block is used
for all peripherals.  Used for development and testing.

=back

This is the underlying function when more control is needed.

=over

=item open_dev_file()

Open device file for IO memory map.
Argument 'file' is the file path to open.  The 'drop_cap' flag indicates
whether the "capabilities" for accessing /dev/mem should be raised/lowered
(1= raise/drop capabilities, 0= not).
The flag defaults to 1, and is provided to allow disabling the raise/drop
of capabilities in case the user needs to manage it himself.

=item close_dev()

Close the device file descriptor.
Apply when no new blocks need to be mapped.
Existing blocks can still be used.
The object destructor will also close the device file, so calling this
function is not required.

=back

=head2			Address Mapping

=over

=item get_mem_block()

Get a peripheral memory block.
Argument 'bcm_addr' is the peripheral address as in the BCM datasheet, block
aligned.
This address is translated into Raspberry Pi-3 physical address.
If the address has already been mapped, that block is returned.
The address is then mapped into a new page with the mmap(2) system call,
if the device file is still open.

=item is_fake_mem()

Return TRUE if using fake memory.

=item bcm2rpi_addr()

Convert address in "BCM2835 ARM Peripherals" datasheet to Raspberry Pi real
address.  Currently only for Raspberry Pi-3.

=back

=head1		EXCEPTIONS

 std::range_error
 std::runtime_error


=head1		RETURN VALUE

Functions are either void, or return valid data.  Exceptions are thrown
where error conditions can be detected.


=head1		EXAMPLES

This is the full sequence of operations.

 // Construct object.
    rgAddrMap          amx;		// address map object

 // Configure, if needed.
    amx.config_Debug( 1 );
    amx.config_FakeNoPi( 0 );
    amx.config_BaseAddr( 0x20000000 );

 // Open device file.
    amx.open_dev_mem();

 // Get pointer to peripheral memory block for GPIO pins.
    volatile uint32_t*		base_addr;
    base_addr = amx.get_mem_block( 0x7e200000 );

 // Close device file, if needed, after all new maps.
    amx.close_dev();
