t_*/    Test code functionality.
	    Can run on RPi or Linux platform.
	    Generally should NOT depend on hardware, i.e.
	    use "rgpio --dev=f" fake memory.

v_*/    Validate RPi hardware behavior.
	    Run on RPi only, other Linux will fail.
	    Each test may require special hardware setup.  See test.cpp


Test Setup:
-----------
    The individual test  t_*/Makefile  has dependency on the test framework,
    but will not rebuild the test framework.

    Build the test framework in src/ (only needed when it changes):
    % cd  src/
    % make

    Tests do NOT rebuild the object being tested.


Run Tests:
----------
    # Run all tests from this directory
    % make test

    # Run a specific test
    % cd t_<dir>/
    % make test

Environment variable 'TESTONRPI' switch in some tests.
    # When running on an RPi
    % TESTONRPI=1  make test

    # When on another platform
    % make test


Strategy:
---------
    Program testing - test.pl
    The idea is to stimulate the program under test with options and input,
    capture the output, and compare against known good output.

    Makefile is the common interface to all test suits, regardless of the
    kind of test.

    Tests should take care not to modify hardware that is in use by the
    operating system, i.e. be safe to run on RPi.

Git:
----
    The .gitignore file has entries to ignore the transient files in each
    test directory:
    t_*/test.exe
    t_*/tmp
