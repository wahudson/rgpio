			rgpio Testing
			-------------

Common aspects of rgpio command testing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## t_*/  Code functionality, platform independent
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    These tests are intended to exercise the essential code functionality.
    They do NOT duplicate full coverage provided by the library class tests.

Simulation Mode:

    Generally all tests apply "rgpio --dev=f" (Fake memory) to be safe
    running on any platform.  This is the fundamental simulation.

    When no simulation mode is specified (no --rpi* option), it defaults
    to the platform the program is running on, which may result in variable
    behavior.  On a non-RPi platform, simulation defaults to --rpi3, the
    original development platform.

    Now with RPi5 all tests should explicitly specify the simulation
    platform for best repeatability on all platforms.

    In retrofitting older tests (i.e. before RPi5), we want to apply the
    highest valid simulation mode for most test cases (e.g. --rpi4).  Not
    trying to exhaustively exercise all valid platforms.
    Probably exercise at least one invalid platform, e.g. --rpi5.
    Gray-box testing.

    The newer RPi5 commands should exercise --rpi5, and limited coverage
    of --rpi4 or --rpi3 to see platform error message.

    Note that some test case conditions draw another error before the
    Feature object is constructed and the platform is validated.  These
    cases would not depend on the platform.  It still may be best to apply
    an explicit platform option for uniformity.

    Historically the platform options did not force Fake memory (but now
    they do), hence applying "--dev=f" may be a bit redundant, but safe.
